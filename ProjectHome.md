DOSRunner is a Windows shell extension (XP, Vista, Windows 7, 32 and 64 bit) to be used with DOSBox (http://www.dosbox.com) that allows users to easily run DOS programs by right clicking the executable/batch file and selecting "Run in DOSBox".

Unlike the "Send to..." hack, it is immediately available in the context menu and not as a submenu.

**Planned features:**
  * configuration via right-click
  * should only appear for DOS-runnable programs

**Requirements**

The program requires a version of DOSBox installed (ANY version, see http://www.dosbox.com)
