DOSRunner
DOSRunner is a Windows shell extension that allows you to run a DOS program easily with DOSBox, without having to do with DOS commands. Just right click the executable, select "Run in DOSBox", and play away.

It works with any version of Windows (from XP to Win7, 32/64 bit), as long as you have a version of DOSBox installed. (See their website http://www.dosbox.com for downloads).

Requirements:
  * Any version of DOSBox

How to use it:
  1. Install DOSRunner using the setup file.
  1. Setup will prompt you for the path of your DOSBox folder. Use the "Browse" button to find the dosbox.exe executable.
  1. After installation, right click any executable you want to run in DOSBox, and select the "Run in DOSBox" option.
  1. Play away.

  * Uninstallation is as easy as clicking the Uninstall link under the "DOSRunner" Start Menu entry.

  * If you want to use it with another DOSBox version, just use the DOSRunner Configurator tool in the Start Menu (Under DOSRunner).

NOTE: For this to work, you must not have modified DOSBox to mount any path by default! just remove any mount commands you might have added to dosbox.conf.
